  <h2>Writing Tips</h2>
  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Plan First:</strong>
    Before you begin drafting, spend time sketching an outline that identifies your thesis statement, the main points you want to make, and specific evidence you will use to support each point. This roadmap keeps your writing focused, helps you spot gaps in your argument early, and makes the drafting process faster and less frustrating.
  </div>
  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Show, Don’t Tell:</strong>
    Instead of stating facts outright (“She was scared”), use vivid, sensory details that allow readers to experience the moment (“Her heart pounded as shadows flickered across the hallway”). Concrete images, active verbs, and sensory language immerse your audience in the scene and make your writing more engaging.
  </div>
  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Quote Integration:</strong>
    When you include a quotation from a text, introduce it by naming the speaker or context, present the quote with quotation marks, and then immediately explain how it supports your point. This three-step approach—introduce, quote, explain—ensures your evidence is always tied back to your argument and avoids “orphaned” quotes.
  </div>
  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Vary Sentence Structure:</strong>
    Balance short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones to create a natural rhythm in your writing. Starting some sentences with transition words, using subordinate clauses, or including rhetorical questions can help maintain reader interest and emphasize key ideas.
  </div>
  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Proofread Carefully:</strong>
    After drafting, set your work aside for a short break, then return to check for grammar errors, punctuation mistakes, and consistency with MLA formatting (in-text citations, Works Cited entries, header, and margins). Reading your essay aloud or using a browser’s spell-check tool can help you catch typos you might otherwise miss.
